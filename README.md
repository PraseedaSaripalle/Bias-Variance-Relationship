# Bias-Variance-Relationship

Bias:
While making predictions, a difference occurs between prediction values made by the model and actual values/expected values, and this difference is known as bias errors or Errors due to bias. 
Bias is a phenomenon that skews the result of an algorithm in favor or against an idea. Bias is considered a systematic error that occurs in the machine learning model itself due to incorrect assumptions in the ML process.

Variance:
Variance is the variability in the model predictionâ€”how much the ML function can adjust depending on the given data set. Variance coThe variance highly complex models with a large number of features.
